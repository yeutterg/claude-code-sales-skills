# Calendar Meeting Setup

Scan Google Calendar for upcoming meetings, identify which ones map to existing accounts, and automatically create meeting notes and daily note entries. Suggests account creation for unrecognized companies.

## Arguments

- No arguments: Today (if morning) or tomorrow (if afternoon/evening)
- `week`: All meetings for the current week (Monday-Friday)
- `next week`: All meetings for the following week (Monday-Friday)
- `YYYY-MM-DD`: All meetings on a specific date
- `tomorrow`: Explicitly target tomorrow regardless of time of day

Example: `/sales-calendar`, `/sales-calendar week`, `/sales-calendar next week`

## Instructions

### Pre-check: Read Config

Read `~/.claude/skills/sales-config.md` and extract:
- `vault_path` -- path to the Obsidian vault
- `company_folder` -- folder name for the company
- `name` -- user's full name
- `initials` -- user's initials
- `calendar_id` -- Google Calendar ID to scan (e.g., `"user@company.com"`)
- `calendar_user_emails` -- list of the user's own email addresses to exclude from attendee lists
- `calendar_mode` -- `"all"` (deal + internal meetings), `"deals"` (deal meetings only)
- `calendar_include_prep` -- whether to create notes for deal prep meetings (true/false)
- `calendar_configured` -- whether calendar has been set up

If `calendar_configured` is not `true`, stop: "Google Calendar is not configured. Run `/sales-setup calendar` to set it up."

**Legacy config migration:** If the config has `calendar_accounts` (list) instead of `calendar_id` (string), use the first account in the list and note to the user that they should re-run `/sales-setup calendar` to update their config.

### Step 1: Determine Date Range

Get the current time and timezone by running `date` in the shell.

**Default behavior (no arguments):**
- If current time is **before 12:00 PM (noon)**: target = today
- If current time is **12:00 PM or later**: target = tomorrow

**With arguments:**
- `week`: Monday through Friday of the current week
- `next week`: Monday through Friday of the following week
- `tomorrow`: tomorrow's date
- `YYYY-MM-DD`: that specific date

Report: "Scanning calendar for {date range description}..."

### Step 2: Fetch Events

Call `mcp__claude_ai_Google_Calendar__gcal_list_events` with:
- `calendarId`: the `calendar_id` from config
- `timeMin` and `timeMax`: cover the target date range (full days, midnight to midnight), in RFC3339 format without timezone suffix
- `timeZone`: the user's local timezone (from the `date` command)
- `condenseEventDetails`: `false` (to get full attendee details)

**Filter out:**
- All-day events (these are not meetings)
- Events with no attendees (personal blocks, focus time)
- Events the user has declined (responseStatus = "declined")
- Events that are cancelled
- Events with summary "Busy" (Notion Calendar blocks)

### Step 3: Classify Each Event

For each remaining event, classify it into one of these categories:

#### 3a: Identify Existing Accounts

List all account folders in `{config.vault_path}/{config.company_folder}/Accounts/`. Build a lookup of:
- Account folder names (e.g., "Acme Corp", "LPL Financial")
- For each account, read the frontmatter of `{Account}.md` to get any `aliases` field

**Match events to accounts** by checking (in order):
1. **Event title contains account name** (case-insensitive, partial match OK): e.g., "LPL Financial Discovery" → LPL Financial
2. **Event title contains an account alias**: e.g., "LPL Fin Demo" matches alias "LPL Fin"
3. **External attendee email domain matches a known account**: Read account frontmatter `website` or `domain` fields if available. Also try matching the company name against the domain (e.g., attendee `@lplfinancial.com` → "LPL Financial")

**Categories:**
- **Deal meeting**: Event matches an existing account AND has external attendees (people not in `calendar_user_emails` and not from `{config.company}` email domain)
- **Deal prep meeting**: Event matches an existing account but has NO external attendees (internal prep/debrief for a deal). Common patterns: title contains "prep", "debrief", "internal", "sync" alongside an account name
- **Internal meeting**: No account match, no external attendees (team standup, 1:1s, all-hands, etc.)
- **External non-deal**: Has external attendees but doesn't match any account (potential new account or non-deal meeting)

#### 3b: Apply Mode Filter

Based on `calendar_mode`:
- `"all"`: Process deal meetings, deal prep (if `calendar_include_prep` is true), internal meetings, and external non-deal
- `"deals"`: Only process deal meetings and deal prep (if `calendar_include_prep` is true). Skip internal and external non-deal.

### Step 4: Create Meeting Notes

Process meetings in parallel where possible using subagents.

#### Deal Meetings (matched to account)

For each deal meeting, create a meeting note following the `/sales-meeting` pattern:

1. **Determine topic**: Extract the topic from the event title by removing the account name. If nothing remains, use "Call".
   - "LPL Financial Discovery" → topic: "Discovery"
   - "Acme Corp" → topic: "Call"
   - "Technical Deep-Dive - Globex" → topic: "Technical Deep-Dive"

2. **Create meeting file** at `{config.vault_path}/{config.company_folder}/Accounts/{Account}/meetings/YYYY-MM-DD {Topic}.md` using the same template as `/sales-meeting`:

```markdown
---
account: "[[{Account}]]"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
gong_url: ""
attendees:
  - "[[{config.name}]]"
  - "[[{Attendee 1 Name}]]"
  - "[[{Attendee 2 Name}]]"
---
## Tasks
- [ ]
## Summary
## Attendees
```dataview
TABLE WITHOUT ID file.link AS "Name", default(account, team) AS "Company/Team", role AS "Role", notes AS "Notes"
WHERE contains(this.attendees, file.link)
```
### New Customer Contacts
| Name | Role | Notes |
| ---- | ---- | ----- |
|      |      |       |
## Notes
### Key Discussion Points
### Technical Details
### Next Steps
## External Summary
## Transcript
```

3. **Populate attendees**: For each attendee NOT in `calendar_user_emails`:
   - Use the display name from the calendar event if available
   - If no display name, derive from email (capitalize first/last name parts)
   - Add as `"[[Display Name]]"` in the frontmatter attendees list
   - Also fill in the "New Customer Contacts" table with Name and any info available

4. **Update daily note** following `/sales-meeting` Step 5 rules:
   - Read account frontmatter for `gong_url`, `salesforce_opportunity*`, `ae`, `csm`
   - Add to the appropriate daily note subsection (Today/Upcoming/Past) with the standard 4-item checklist
   - Use full wiki-link paths

5. **Skip if file exists**: If a meeting file with the same name already exists, skip it and report it.

#### Deal Prep Meetings (if calendar_include_prep is true)

For each deal prep meeting:

1. Create a simpler meeting file at the same account meetings path: `YYYY-MM-DD {Account} Prep.md` (or use the event title if more descriptive)

```markdown
---
account: "[[{Account}]]"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
attendees:
  - "[[{config.name}]]"
  - "[[{Internal Attendee}]]"
---
## Tasks
- [ ]
## Notes
## Action Items
```

2. Add to daily note under the appropriate subsection, but with a simpler checklist:
```
- [[{path}|YYYY-MM-DD {Topic}]] (prep)
```

#### Internal Meetings (if calendar_mode is "all")

For each internal meeting, create a simple meeting note at the vault root (not under any account):

File: `{config.vault_path}/YYYY-MM-DD {Event Title}.md`

```markdown
---
date: YYYY-MM-DD
attendees:
  - "[[{config.name}]]"
  - "[[{Attendee Name}]]"
---
## Notes
```

Add to daily note under `## Meetings` (no subsection needed, no checklist):
```
- [[YYYY-MM-DD {Event Title}]]
```

If the file already exists, skip.

#### External Non-Deal Meetings

Create a meeting note at the vault root like internal meetings, but track the company for the end-of-run report.

### Step 5: Report Results

Output a structured summary:

```
Calendar scan complete for {date range}.

## Deal Meetings Created
| Account | Meeting | Date | Attendees |
|---------|---------|------|-----------|
| Acme Corp | Discovery | 3/10 | Jane Smith, Bob Chen |
| LPL Financial | Technical Review | 3/10 | Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg |

## Deal Prep Meetings Created (or "Skipped — prep meetings disabled")
| Account | Meeting | Date |
|---------|---------|------|
| Acme Corp | Prep | 3/10 |

## Internal Meetings Created (or "Skipped — deals-only mode")
- 2026-03-10 Team Standup
- 2026-03-10 1:1 with Manager

## Skipped (already existed)
- Acme Corp: 2026-03-10 Discovery.md already exists

## Unrecognized External Meetings
These meetings have external attendees but don't match any account:

| Meeting | Attendees | Likely Company |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| Intro Call with Contoso | dan@contoso.com | Contoso |
| Coffee Chat | jane@newstartup.io | New Startup |

Would you like to create accounts for any of these?
- `/sales-create-account Contoso`
- `/sales-create-account New Startup`
```

If there are unrecognized external meetings, ask the user: "Would you like me to run `/sales-create-account` for any of these? I can create the accounts and then set up the meeting notes."

If the user says yes for any, run `/sales-create-account` for each, then create the meeting notes for those events.

### Rules

- Never overwrite existing meeting files
- Always use Title Case for meeting topics
- Use full wiki-link paths in daily notes (same as `/sales-meeting`)
- Exclude the user's own emails from attendee lists
- When multiple events match the same account on the same day, create separate meeting files for each (append a distinguishing topic)
- If two events have the exact same account + topic + date, append a number: "Discovery 2"
- Handle timezone correctly: use the timezone from `get-current-time` for all date comparisons
- For multi-day ranges (week/next week), create all meeting files but only update daily notes for days that fall on today or in the future (skip past dates per `/sales-meeting` rules)
